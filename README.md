# HC-SR04-Raspberry-Pi-Adapter

This is just my attempt at making a neat solution to connection up an HC-SR04 ultrasonic connector to a raspberry pi. It could be done with some protoboard, but that just doesn't look tidy.

Feel free to use the fritzing design to get some made.
Along with the board you'll need a 330 ohm resistor and a 470 ohm resitor.
